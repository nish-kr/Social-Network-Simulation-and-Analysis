-This is a discrete time event social Network Simulator and Analyser.
-This project was created as part of a course project under Prof. Subodh Kumar , IIT Delhi , 2013.
-This project has been tested and developed on linux computers .

******************************************************************************************************************
SIMULATION

-To run the "networkGen" , i.e. program to generate and simulate the network ,
	 open a terminal in the folder "networkGen" and run the following command :
	 	"make"
	 	"./run.sh -d (Number of Days for which the execution is to be done) (Input File name)".

-A sample input file has been provided named as "SocialNetworkEnv.inp".
-The generic Structure of the graphml file is :
	UNIVERSITY university_name
	DEPARTMENT dept_name num_faculty num_students_per_year semester_dept_courses
	semeseter_nondept_courses
	COURSE course_number dept_that_offers frequency_per_year
	INTEREST interest_name popularity
	HOSTEL hostel_name
	HOUSELOCALITY locality_name
	FRIENDSHIPRATE req_per_minute
	OPENNESS out_probability
	FRIENDLINESS recip_probability
	RANDOMSEED faculty_random student_random course_random friend_random

-This program produces "logFile.txt" , "graph.graphml" and "universities.txt".
	--logFile.txt : Contains all log of all the events that took place in the simulation.
	--graph.graphml : Contains the generated graph saved in graphml format.
	--universities.txt : Contains the list of the Universities mentioned as input in the input file.

******************************************************************************************************************
ANALYSIS
-To run the Analysis part, please copy the above "graph.graphml" and "universities.txt" into the folder "Analyser".
-Open a terminal in the folder "Analyser" and execute the following commands:
	"make"
	"./run.sh"
-Upon running the above commands, a perl script will start which will ask as input the name of the graphml file to
	be analysed.Please input the name of the graphml file copied earlier.
-Once the perl Script starts, it will take some time to preprocess the data and then it will present a UI where user can 
	ask questions regarding the generated graph.
-6 Questions are presently supported :
	1. Size of Clique of a given person (identified by university name and ID)
	2. The length of the shortest path between two given people
	3. The list of people on the shortest path between two given people
	4. The shortest path in the graph (between any pair of people)
	5. The importance of the given person (the importance is the number of the all-pair shortest
	paths that include that person)
	6. Is any of the friends of a given person more important that him/her

- To provide the university name and ID of the person, input the name of the university as in the input file [case does not matter].
	To provide the ID , give the ID as sX or fX , where s stands for student and f stands for faculty.
	Thus, for example to ask Q1 ask the question -"size of the clique of IITD s4" or "size of the clique of IITD f2".
- At present user must provide a check on the ID number of the person , as at present there is no provision for checking if the ID 			number of the person is within bounds.
-ID bounds can be checked from the input file from the line "DEPARTMENT dept_name num_faculty num_students_per_year			 				semester_dept_courses". Here this line occurs for each university's department and the number num_faculty denotes the number of      	faculty in the department and num_students_per_year denotes the number of students taken in the department per year.

IMPORTANT NOTES

-To read any further information please check the folder "User Manual and Reports" and find the user manual there.
-To run the perl module perl module "termKey" needs to be installed - this has been provided in the folder - "User manuals and reports/perland doxygen modules".
-Both networkGen and Analyser contain doxygen files built and the corresponding "refman.pdf", latex and HTML files for code documentation.

-IN CASE THE USER DOES NOT EXIT THE PERL SCRIPT BY PRESSING "q" , NO CLEAN UP ACTION WILL BE TAKEN AND MESSAGE QUEUES WILL BE LEFT OVER IN THE SYSTEM. IN THAT CASE PLEASE RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMAND IN THE FOLDER - "Analyser" : "make" , "./bash_file.sh" .THIS WILL REMOVE THE MESSAGE QUEUES IN THAT CASE .
