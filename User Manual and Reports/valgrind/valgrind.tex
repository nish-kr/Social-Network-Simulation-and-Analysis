{\Huge VALGRIND REPORT }{\Huge \par}

1) Valgrind was run using the memcheck tool for both the phases :

- networkGen 

- Analyser



2) The following command was used to run the valgrind for both :

- for first phase (NetworkGen) :valgrind --leak-check=full ./run.sh
-d 200 sample 

- for second phase ( Analyser ) : valgrind --leak-check=full ./run.sh




3) The following output was obtained :






-for the first phase :

==27008== For counts of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with:

4) Thus as can be seen from the output of the valgrind , there is
no memory leak .
